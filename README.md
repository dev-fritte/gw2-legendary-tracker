# GW2 Legendary Tracker

A Guild Wars 2 tool that analyzes your characters' equipment and recommends which legendary weapons to craft next, ranked by how many character slots would benefit.

## Features

- **Zommoros' Choice** — connects to your GW2 account, lets you pick which characters to include, and ranks legendary weapon recommendations by impact (number of non-legendary slots across all selected characters that would benefit)
- **Legendary Armory awareness** — weapons already covered by your armory are shown separately in an "Already have" section
- **Equipment template support** — correctly handles multiple equipment tabs per character
- **Localization** — English and German, auto-detected from the browser, stored per session
- **Dark theme** — GW2-style dark UI with profession-colored character chips

## GW2 API Usage

All requests go directly to `https://api.guildwars2.com/v2` from the browser using the API key as an `access_token` query parameter (no server-side proxy needed). Data is cached via React Query:

| Endpoint | Cache |
|---|---|
| `/v2/account` | session |
| `/v2/characters` | 5 min |
| `/v2/account/legendaryarmory` | 5 min |
| `/v2/items` | 1 hour |
| `/v2/professions` | permanent |

## Privacy

Your API key is stored only in your browser's `localStorage` and is never sent to any third-party server.

### Roadmap

- [x] Check ALL Weapons not only the one you have equipped
- [ ] Number of character which are able to equip the weapon type
- [ ] plain Roadmap
- [ ] add starterkits to roadmap selection
- [ ] add material/crafing calculations to check how expensive the legendary item is
- [ ] scan snowcrows benchmarks for number of builds with the specific weapon
